# WhatsApp Cab Booking Bot ðŸš—âœ¨

WhatsApp Cab Booking Bot is a Node.js project designed for booking cabs from WhatsApp. It includes two sections: one for users who can book cabs via chat on WhatsApp, and another for owners who can use commands to confirm, cancel, or view all bookings.

## User Section

Users can effortlessly book cabs via chat on the WhatsApp bot by selecting available options, making the cab booking process more user-friendly.

## Owner Section

Owners are equipped with specific commands that can be sent as messages to the WhatsApp bot, enabling them to manage bookings efficiently. The available commands include:


#### Owner Commands

- **Show Single Bookings:**
  - Command: `"show booking"` or  `"show bookings"`
  - Description: View a list of all current bookings.

- **Mark Booking as Complete:**
  - Command: `"complete"`
  - Description: Mark a booking as complete, indicating that the service has been provided.
  
  
Additionally, other commands are option-based and can be selected as needed:

- **Option-based Commands:**
  - Owners can choose from a set of options provided by the bot for specific actions.

Owners can use these commands to interact with the WhatsApp bot and stay informed about bookings or mark them as completed.

## Booking Confirmation Process

When a user books a cab, the system follows a confirmation process involving the owner. The booking goes through the following stages:

1. **User Books Cab:**
   - User completes the booking process.

2. **Message Sent to Owner:**
   - The system automatically sends a message to the owner informing them about the new booking.

3. **Owner Confirmation:**
   - Owner reviews the booking details.
   - If the owner confirms the booking, the cab is marked as  booked.
   - If the owner does not confirm, the booking remains in a pending phase.
   - if the owner reject the booking, its marked as Cancelled

This confirmation process ensures that the cab is only fully booked when the owner confirms the user's booking request.
